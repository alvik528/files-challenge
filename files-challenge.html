		<p>Roronoa Zoro aspires to be the strongest swordsman in the entire world. He is the first mate to the Strawhat Pirates and he
		is the second strongest member only behind his captain. He has fought with the likes of CP9, Hawkeye Mihawk, and even Admiral Fujitora. He is willing to put his life on the line for his captain as any good crewmate should.</p>
		<p>You can view Zoro's journey with his crewmates on the ever exciting one piece! You will be able to catch new episodes on saturdays at 9pm on <a href="http://www1.watchop.com/">watch one piece.com!</a></p>
